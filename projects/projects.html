    <h1>PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1>
    <h2>BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION</h2>
    <p>The free range poultry sector in Kenya is a vital source of livelihoods for smallholder farmers and indigenous poultry farming has significant potential to improve livelihoods and food security. However, multiple restrictions exist to production and marketing of poultry products, including a lack of knowledge of enriched poultry methods and the weak bargaining position of famers in the market.</p>
    <p>Free range chicken farming is a very profitable business, and several people are making cash all over the world by raising free range chickens. However, to build a fruitful, sustainable free range poultry farming business, you require adequate knowledge of how to competently raise free range organic chickens, good management skills, and a worthy poultry farming business plan.</p>
    <p>The richest man in the world and Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, regards Chicken business venture as a lucrative business. He is giving out hundreds of thousands of chickens as a means of empowering people to earn an income by starting chicken farming businesses. In his article on his website, “Why I would raise Chickens,” Bill Gates states that Chickens are a good venture which can make a lot of revenue for the people as they have a multiplicative effect, due to the fact that they lay and hatch eggs frequently, thus multiplying the size of your flock.</p>
    <p>In Bangladesh there is a model known as poverty alleviation and gender. The model is about poultry keeping at household level. The concept has been developed through more than 20 years learning process in Bangladesh and targets the poorest of the poor mainly women. The aim is to make this group sustainable by giving them access to small loans for which they can buy hens. Furthermore, this access to credit, poultry production, market facilities, poultry health services, feed and improved hens makes it easier for the target group to generate income.</p>
    <p>We believe this project will generate income for the benefit of farmers, their families and some vulnerable people living in Nyeri and Kerinyaga. Indeed research and analysis have shown that the government alone cannot succeed to reduce poverty to all Kenyans. Poverty is increasing despite the efforts of the Government to reduce it. Concerted efforts are needed from the people themselves as well as other stakeholders.</p>

    <p>Our firm will work to strengthen this important segment and capitalize on the potential presented by poultry farming to improve the livelihoods and food security of underprivileged smallholder farmers.</p>
    <h1>Problem statement</h1>
    <p>Farmers lack access to better prices for their animal produce due to lack of markets in rural areas. TRFTTE will provide e-platform to enable farmers sell choice meat produce to consumers in towns and cities in Kenya.</p>
    <p>Poor and low productivity of animal produce due to lack of relevant information hence poor livelihood. TRFTTE will empower farmers through outreach training, animal welfare, sound financial management practices and support through lending.
    Farmers lose big fortunes when calamities strike due to poor risk management practices. TRFTTE will educate farmers on good risk management practices and organize for cheap insurance cover for their animals.</p>
    <p>The marketing of free range chicken is conducted at the open markets or productions site and involves the selling of live birds to individuals or to middlemen. Consumers especially those living in towns and cities lack access to free range animal products and as a result they live in constant fear for their health since they are not sure of the source of products they are consuming. TRFTTE will provide an e-platform and USSD channel to enable consumers access free range animal products from farmers.</p> <br>This will guarantee consumers the following benefits;</br>


    <ul>
    <li>Access to excellent quality & amazing taste products.</li>
     <li>Enjoy organic Produce free of preservatives, insecticides, antibiotics, and growth promotants.</li>
    <li>Be aware of  the source of the food they are consuming</li>
    <li>Comfortable in knowing that Ethical and humane animal treatment is practiced.</li>
    <p>Lack of constant Supply of free range animal produce in the Kenyan markets due to disorganized, chaotic and outdated farming practices by farmers. To ensure constant supply, the following will be done.</p>
    <h2>Immediate</h2>
    <h3>Free range chicken meat production and delivery</h3>
    <p>A free range chicken is a bird that is allowed constant access to the outdoors, with plenty of fresh vegetation, sunshine and room to exercise. This type of chicken has not been given any chemicals (antibiotics). Figure 1 below shows free range chicken grazing in the field.</p>

    Figure 1
    <p>Birds raised on pasture are incredibly vulnerable to all sorts of natural calamities. Unrelenting heat, Freezing wind and snow. A seemingly endless list of predators (foxes, hawks, raccoons, neighbor’s dogs, etc.). And because laying hens need about 16 hours of light each day to lay their best, even daylight can be a major factor. Still, when properly managed, raising birds this way ensures a life filled with fresh air, green grass, and beautiful sunshine.</p>
    <p>Farmers will be trained on how to take care of the birds so as to reap maximum benefits. Chickens will be received and butchered when they reach about 6-8 months.</p>
    <h2>Creating the supply</h2>
    <h3>PROJEC ACTIVITIES AND WORK PLAN</h3>
    <p>Because TRFTTE’s immediate focus is to provide free range chicken meat to consumers, the following will be done to guarantee continuous and constant supply.</p>
    <ul>


    <li>Organize 500 farmers, of whom 50% will be women, into 50 groups of 10 members each. Each group will receive 4 training sessions on different elements of the poultry value chain as well as training on disease diagnosis, vaccination, feeding, brooding, poultry management and improved housing from TRFTTE and government trainers.</li>
    <li>50 farmers will be trained in feed formulation and feeding regimes for birds at different ages. Self Help Group clusters to facilitate training and data collection will be established in 4 locations, incorporating 10 groups in 5 clusters. Similar clusters will be established in other locations as the number of farmers increases.</li>
    <li>Establish 4 demonstration sites at which training on improved technologies will take place - In year one of the Poultry Production and Marketing Project, TRFTTE will mobilize poultry groups and disseminate information on the benefits and purpose of demonstration sites. The initial project design will include four demonstration sites to serve all groups. However, in year two, through consultations with communities and an assessment of their training needs, additional demonstration sites will be added.  Each of these demo sites will be equipped with poultry feeders and drinkers and stocked with improved poultry breeds.  One demo open day to provide training on cultivating drought tolerant crops such as cassava, sorghum, sun flowers and green grams to use in chicken feed formulation.</li>
    <li>To train groups in group dynamics, gender and leadership. Production groups are the focus of training of poultry products, so the impact on the project will be determined by the effectiveness and sustainability of the groups.</li>
    <li>All groups will receive 4 separate training sessions on the stages of group formation, conflict resolution, record keeping, and gender roles. The manuals developed to guide training delivered to the groups, but will also serve to provide guidance on groups.</li>
    <li>Group members to identify 2 community-based trainers per group to provide technical support to farmers in their group. Regular training session and technical support to farmers will be regularly conducted through peer learning with the Training of Trainers approach.<li>
    <li>Farmers will be required to purchase Hens and cockerels to build up a commercially viable flock size - The project to procure and distribute a total of 100 improved Ken bro cockerels among the farmers to crossbreed with local chickens.
    Poultry stocks will also be boosted through a vaccination program against fowl pox and Newcastle disease. This will be conducted by farmers with assistance from government extension officers and other professionals.</li>
    <li>Famers will be advised to keep the right size of free range poultry which will be begged on the size of land in possession. Housing for poultry will be in a site well-drained with proper ventilation to promote plenty of natural air circulation and lighting. The equipment like drinkers, feeders, and nest boxes will be required to be installed by the famer.</li>
    <li>Each free range chicken requires about 0.1 square meters of floor space which translates to 10 birds per square meter. Training will focus on equipping famers with correct information of ensuring sufficient space in order for the free range chickens to grow well and to avoid possible suffocation of the flock that can be brought by the crowding of the birds.</li>
    <li>To ensure quality meat and eggs, farmers will be instructed to allow birds get exposure to the sun, dirt and fresh air so as to feed a variety of greens, plants, worms and insects. An acre is an adequate supply of pasture for 200 adult birds or 300 chicks
    Incubators to hatch eggs will be purchased and stationed in a central location in Nyeri and Kerinyaga, where all the farmers can access services. The incubator is to provide a sustainable source of one-day-old chicks to poultry groups while allowing hens to continue laying eggs for a longer period contributing to increased production. Farmers from the project groups will be identified and trained on egg handling and will supply fertile eggs for hatching. They will be responsible for managing the incubator.</li> <li>Farmers will bring fertilized eggs, which will be incubated and one-day-old chickens offered back. The project will purchase a generator to avoid losses attributed to egg spoilage as a result of power fluctuations. Farmers will be encouraged to bring eggs every after two weeks to the hatcheries center. A good record of farmers’ eggs and the number of chicks offered will be maintained. Farmers will be notified through SMS and USSD channel when to collect the chicks.</li>
    <li>Chicks are to be fed store-bought feed for a period of 3 or 4 weeks after which allowed access to tender green pasture and freely wander, scratch and peck in the soil so as to access necessary mineral and proteins. Adequate shelter, fencing and protection from predators such as dogs and hawks is necessary. Figure 2 below shows free range chicks in a brooder.<li>

    Fig 2. Free range chicks in a brooder.
    <p>A chicken growth rate is dependent on its breed and nutrition. Some mature earlier than others. A well- cared for chicken of commonly kept breeds will be fully mature by 8 months old. They usually are ready for breeding and can be consumed at that age.
    Constant supply of meat products will be achieved at the 8th month from the commencement date of the project.
    A wide database of participating farmers will be maintained. It will contain the name, id no, phone no and the number of birds a farmer can supply at any particular time.<p/>
